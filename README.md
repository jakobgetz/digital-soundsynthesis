# digital-soundsynthesis

This repository contains four little applications which are created to assist my argumentation for my bachelor thesis: <br/>
<b>"audio in the browser - implementation of a digital sound generator with the web audio api"</b> <br/>
To read the whole thesis in german visit: <b>www.jakobgetz.com/digital-soundsynthesis/thesis</b></br>
It is recommended to use chrome as your browser for trying out theese applications.

## basic-osciallator
  
  This program is created to demonstrate the basic functionality of the web audio api's OscillatorNode. It consists out of one HTML file and can be opened through the browser.<br/>
  - You will find an online version of this program here: <b>www.jakobgetz.com/digital-soundsynthesis/basic-oscillator</b><br/>
  - To download the source code visit the branch "basic-osccilator" of this repository
  
  ## custom-wave-shapes
  
  This program is created to demonstrate the properties of the web audio api's PeriodicWave object. This object provides the developer with a possibility to create custom wave shapes for digital sound generation via additive synthesis. <br/>
  - You will find an online version of this program here: <b>www.jakobgetz.com/digital-soundsynthesis/custom-wave-shapes</b><br/>
  - To download the source code visit the branch "custom-wave-shapes" of this repository
  
  ## fft
  
  This program is created to demonstrate the usage of the Fast-Fourier-Transform in JavaScript. It uses the package fft-js: https://github.com/vail-systems/node-fft <br/>
  - To download the source code visit the branch "fft" of this repository. You will need node installed to execute the application
  
  ## oscillator
  
  This react application is a full implementation of an oscillator which provides possibilities for generating sound via additive synthesis, resynthesis and wavetable synthesis. It comes whith three example wavetables provided by Steve Duda: https://xferrecords.com<br/>
  - You will find an online version of this application here: <b>www.jakobgetz.com/digital-soundsynthesis/oscillator</b><br/>
  - To download the wavetables or source code visit the branch "oscillator" of this repository
